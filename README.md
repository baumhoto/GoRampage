# GoRampage
RetroRampage Tutorial Series for Go

Learning Go by following https://github.com/nicklockwood/RetroRampage and implement it in Go instead of Swift.

~~Decided to use https://github.com/gonutz/prototype 2D Prototype Gaming Framework because it seems to be simple enough~~

Switched to ebiten https://github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten as it allows to more closely replicate the original raycast implementation.
